# Multi-Tenant Architecture Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully updated the database schema to support a multi-tenant architecture for the Sanicle SaaS system. This architecture allows different companies or organizations to register and use the system, with appropriate role-based access control.

## Changes Made

1. **Schema Updates**:
   - Added `Organization` table to store company details
   - Enhanced `User` table with organization relationship and superadmin flag
   - Added `Employee` table for employee-specific information
   - Added `UserRole` table for flexible role assignment
   - Added organization_id to all relevant tables for proper data isolation

2. **Migration Process**:
   - Generated migration files using Drizzle ORM
   - Applied schema changes using `drizzle-kit push`
   - Created initial test data for Sanicle organization and a superadmin user

3. **Role Hierarchy**:
   - Superadmin: Can manage all organizations and their users
   - Organization Admin: Can manage their organization and create HR accounts
   - HR: Can manage employees within their organization
   - Employee: Basic access to their own data

4. **Data Isolation**:
   - Each organization's data is properly isolated
   - Users can only access data relevant to their organization
   - Superadmin can access all data across organizations

## Verification

We have verified that:
- The database schema has been successfully updated
- Organization and user tables have the proper structure
- Foreign key relationships are properly established
- Initial test data has been created

## Next Steps

1. **UI Implementation**:
   - Update login flow to support organization context
   - Create organization management UI for superadmins
   - Implement organization-specific dashboards

2. **API Enhancements**:
   - Implement organization-based filtering in all API endpoints
   - Add organization management endpoints
   - Update user management to support the role hierarchy

3. **Testing**:
   - Test role-based access control for different user types
   - Verify data isolation between organizations
   - Test user management across the role hierarchy
