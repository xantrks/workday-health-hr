# English-Only Content Enforcement

- All text content must be in English only
- No Chinese characters allowed in any project files
- This includes comments, strings, variable names, and documentation
- Ensures code consistency and improves collaboration with international teams

You can check for Chinese characters using Unicode ranges:
- \u4E00-\u9FFF (CJK Unified Ideographs)
- \u3400-\u4DBF (CJK Extension A)
- \u20000-\u2A6DF (CJK Extension B)
- \uF900-\uFAFF (CJK Compatibility Ideographs)

Fix violations by translating Chinese text to English and using localization files if necessary.
