## 🧠 IBM Cloud watsonx AI Integration

The platform features dual AI capabilities, leveraging both Google's Gemini AI and IBM's watsonx AI to provide comprehensive women's health support.

### Overview

While the main AI Health Assistant (accessed via the Women's Health Assistant button) uses Google's Gemini AI, the platform also integrates IBM's watsonx AI through a convenient chat widget located in the bottom-right corner of the employee dashboard.

### Features

- **Accessible Chat Widget**: Always available in the employee dashboard interface
- **Specialized Health Focus**: Trained specifically for women's health conversations
- **Real-time Streaming Responses**: Provides dynamic, typing-like response generation
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Leverages IBM Cloud's robust security infrastructure
- **Multi-modal Integration**: Complements the primary Gemini-based AI assistant

### Architecture

The watsonx AI integration follows a client-server architecture:

#### Frontend Implementation
- **Chat Widget Component**: A floating button in the bottom-right corner of the employee dashboard that expands into a chat interface
- **Real-time UI**: Supports both standard and streaming response modes with typing indicators
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when the service is unavailable
- **Markdown Rendering**: Properly formats AI responses with Markdown styling

#### Backend Implementation
- **API Route**: Dedicated `/api/watsonx-chat` endpoint for handling chat requests
- **IBM Cloud Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with IBM Cloud IAM
- **Streaming Support**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time response streaming
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Mock responses when the service is unavailable
- **Debugging Features**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### Configuration

To use the IBM watsonx AI feature, you need to configure the following environment variables:

```env
# IBM WatsonX AI configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_WATSONX_API_URL=https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com/ml/v4/deployments
WATSONX_API_KEY=your_watsonx_api_key
WATSONX_DEPLOYMENT_ID=your_watsonx_deployment_id
WATSONX_TOKEN_URL=https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token
WATSONX_VERSION=2021-05-01
```

### Setup Instructions

1. **Create an IBM Cloud Account**: Sign up at [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/)
2. **Provision watsonx.ai Service**: Set up the watsonx.ai service in your IBM Cloud dashboard
3. **Create a Model Deployment**: Deploy a language model (the project uses llama-3-405b-instruct)
4. **Get API Credentials**: Generate an API key from your IBM Cloud dashboard
5. **Configure Environment Variables**: Add the required variables to your `.env.local` file
6. **Test the Integration**: Verify the chat widget appears in the employee dashboard

### Technical Implementation Details

The watsonx AI integration is built with these key components:

1. **Environment Configuration** (`lib/env.ts`): Manages watsonx-specific environment variables
2. **API Client** (`lib/watsonx.ts`): Handles authentication and communication with IBM Cloud API
3. **API Route** (`app/api/watsonx-chat/route.ts`): Next.js API route for processing chat requests
4. **Chat UI Components**:
   - `ChatWidget.tsx`: Main widget interface with expand/collapse functionality
   - `ChatMessage.tsx`: Renders individual chat messages with Markdown support

The implementation supports both standard API calls and streaming responses for a more dynamic user experience.

### Error Handling and Fallbacks

The system includes robust error handling:
- Automatic fallback to mock responses when the API is unavailable
- Informative error messages for different failure scenarios
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting integration issues

### Security Considerations

- API keys are securely handled server-side only
- Authentication tokens are generated for each session
- User chat data is not permanently stored unless explicitly configured

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

Sanicle-AI prioritizes user privacy with the following measures:

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Complete data isolation between organizations
- **Data Anonymization**: HR dashboard only shows anonymized, aggregated data
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Secure communication for all health data
- **Role-Based Access**: Strict permission system for different user types
- **GDPR Compliance**: All data handling adheres to GDPR principles
- **Secure Authentication**: Advanced auth system with JWT and next-auth
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking for security monitoring

## 🗄️ Database Schema

Our database design includes the following core tables:

- `Organization`: Multi-tenant organization information
- `User`: User profiles and authentication data
- `Employee`: Employee-specific profile information
- `Role` and `UserRole`: Role-based access control system
- `HealthRecord`: Health tracking data including menstrual cycles, symptoms, etc.
- `LeaveRequest`: Health-related leave management
