# Sanicle AI - FemTech Health Platform Demo Script

## Introduction

Hello everyone, and thank you for joining me today. I'm excited to walk you through our innovative FemTech Health Platform called Sanicle AI. This platform is designed specifically to support women's health in the workplace, providing a comprehensive solution that bridges the gap between personal health management and professional life.

Today, I'll be demonstrating the key features we've developed so far, showing you how Sanicle AI is revolutionizing the way professional women manage their health and how companies can support their female employees' wellbeing.

## User Registration Process

Let's start with how new users join our platform.

When a user visits Sanicle AI for the first time, they're greeted with our intuitive registration page.

As you can see, our registration form collects essential information:
- First and last name
- Email address
- Password (with confirmation)
- Agreement to terms and privacy policy

What makes our registration process special is its simplicity combined with security. We've implemented robust validation to ensure data integrity while keeping the process straightforward.

After submitting the form, the system securely encrypts the password before storing it in our database, and the user receives a confirmation that their account has been created successfully.

## User Login System

Now, let's see how existing users access their accounts.

Our login page features a clean, user-friendly interface where users enter their email and password. We've implemented secure authentication using NextAuth.js, which provides enterprise-grade security for user credentials.

Once logged in, the system identifies the user's role and automatically redirects them to the appropriate dashboard - either the employee dashboard or the HR dashboard.

## Role-Based Access Control

Speaking of different dashboards, let's talk about our role-based access control system.

Sanicle AI currently supports two primary user roles:
- Employees: Regular users who manage their personal health data
- HR Professionals: Users with additional privileges to view anonymized workforce health analytics

Our middleware layer performs role verification on every request, ensuring users can only access areas appropriate to their role. If someone attempts to access unauthorized sections, they're automatically redirected to an "Unauthorized Access" page.

For administrative purposes, we've also implemented a special admin interface where administrators can assign HR roles to specific users. This ensures proper governance of who can access sensitive analytics data.

## AI Health Assistant

Now for one of our most exciting features - the AI Health Assistant!

This intelligent chatbot provides personalized health guidance based on the user's role. Let me demonstrate:

For employees, the AI assistant focuses on:
- Personal health management
- Menstrual cycle tracking advice
- Workplace wellbeing strategies
- Preparing for medical appointments

For HR professionals, the assistant provides:
- Workforce health trends analysis
- Leave pattern insights
- Employee wellbeing policy recommendations
- Health-related HR guidance

The assistant adapts its responses based on the user's language preferences. It can detect and respond in multiple languages, including English and Chinese, making it accessible to a diverse workforce.

## Employee Dashboard

Let's explore the employee dashboard, which is the heart of the platform for individual users.

The dashboard is organized into four main tabs:

### Overview Tab
This provides a quick snapshot of the user's health status, including:
- Next period prediction
- Recent mood status
- Upcoming medical appointments
- Important notifications

### Period Tracking Tab
This powerful feature includes:
- An interactive calendar for tracking menstrual cycles
- Period flow recording
- Symptom logging
- Mood and sleep tracking
- Pattern analysis to predict future cycles

The calendar uses color coding to visualize different cycle phases, making it easy for users to understand their patterns at a glance.

### Health Status Tab
Here users can monitor various health metrics:
- Sleep quality
- Stress levels
- Exercise tracking
- Nutrition notes
- Overall wellbeing scores

### Medical Appointments Tab
This section helps users manage their healthcare schedule:
- Upcoming appointments
- Appointment history
- Reminders for regular check-ups
- Post-appointment note recording

## HR Dashboard

For HR professionals, we've created a specialized dashboard that provides valuable workforce insights while maintaining individual privacy.

The HR dashboard features:
- Total employee statistics
- Leave rate analytics
- Health satisfaction metrics
- Anonymized health trend data

HR professionals can use this information to:
- Identify potential workplace health issues
- Develop targeted wellbeing programs
- Track the effectiveness of health initiatives
- Make data-driven decisions about workplace policies

All data shown is carefully anonymized to protect employee privacy while still providing actionable insights.

## Data Security & Privacy

Throughout the platform, we've implemented robust security measures:
- Password encryption using bcrypt
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Data anonymization for HR analytics
- Secure API endpoints

Privacy is built into the design, ensuring that sensitive health information remains confidential and protected.

## Conclusion

1. Secure user management with role-based access
2. AI-powered health guidance tailored to user needs
3. Comprehensive health tracking tools for employees
4. Valuable, anonymized insights for HR professionals

Our vision is to continue expanding these capabilities, creating a platform that truly transforms how companies support women's health and wellbeing.
